## Value Proposition Canvas:

As part of the Strategy Plane (Chapter 3 of The Elements of User Experience), a Value Proposition Canvas is used to identify user needs and the application’s objectives. This user-centered approach allows for mapping solutions based on user goals. Additionally, the Canvas is an iterative tool that continuously adjusts based on feedback received.

## Benchmark:
As part of the Strategy Plane, the importance of understanding the competitive environment is addressed, referring to the need for a competitive analysis. In our case, this involves visiting similar websites and applications to identify strengths and weaknesses. Observing how users interact with similar products can provide valuable insights into market expectations and standards. Comparing features and functionalities with those of other products can help better define the project’s requirements and priorities.

The importance of this can be summarized as follows:

- Identifying Best Practices: Seeing what strategies and approaches have worked well in other similar contexts can provide valuable insights for your own design.
- Differentiation: Helps identify ways to differentiate your product or service by highlighting unique features or improving areas where other products are deficient.
- Avoiding Common Mistakes: Learning from the mistakes and deficiencies observed in other products can prevent making the same errors in your own product development.
